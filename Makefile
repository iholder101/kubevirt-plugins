# The test and vet targets auto-wrap through hack/dockerized so no local Go
# toolchain is required. Set KUBEVIRT_PLUGINS_SKIP_DOCKERIZED=true to skip the
# wrapper and run Go directly (e.g. when Go is available locally, or when
# already running inside the builder container). The functest target
# dockerizes the same way internally (see hack/functests.sh): only its final
# ginkgo invocation needs Go, so that's the only part that runs containerized.
#
# Tests are scoped to ./pkg/... on purpose: the suites under tests/ are
# Ginkgo functional tests that need a live cluster and are run via the
# functest target, not plain `go test`.
#
# cluster-up, cluster-down, and cluster-sync run directly on the host: they
# must talk to the host's own podman/docker to create cluster-node
# containers that stay reachable (via kubectl, functest, cluster-down) after
# the script exits, so dockerizing them would only relocate the same
# host-engine dependency, not remove it.
